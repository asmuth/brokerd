/**
 * A growing/growable buffer class.
 *
 * A buffer has both a "capacity" and a "logical size" used to describe the
 * number of used bytes in the buffer and the size of the backing memory
 * allocation respectively. The capacity is always greater or equal to the
 * logical size.
 *
 * A buffer is always backed by one contiguous chunk of memory that is
 * dynamically alloced/realloced as needed. The backing memory allocation is
 * "capacity" bytes large and contains logical size bytes of data (stored as one
 * contiguous block starting at offset 0)
 *
 * The append methods will append new data to the end of the buffer, i.e. after
 * the Nth byte where N = logical size, increasing the logical size and
 * allocating new memory as needed.
 *
 * You can also retrieve a mutable pointer to the backing storage by calling
 * the data() method and write directly into the backing storage.
 *
 * In order to keep this class simple and predictable it does _not_ try to be
 * smart about memory allocations, ie. it will not pre-allocate anything and
 * won't optimistically preallocate more memory than required to store it's
 * contents unless you tell it to.
 *
 * This means writing directly to a buffer in small increments without calling
 * reserve first can be slow as it will incur a lot of memory allocations.
